Here is an simple R plot which will be displayed in the hover preview.
```{r}
#| label: fig-base-plot
plot(1:10)
```

Here is an interactive plot which won't be displayed in the hover preview.
```{r}
#| label: fig-plotly
#| message: false
library(plotly)
plot_ly(x = 1:10, y = 1:10, z = 10:1, type = 'scatter3d', mode = 'markers')
```

When you hover over the link to @fig-base-plot you see a preview, but not for @fig-plotly.
